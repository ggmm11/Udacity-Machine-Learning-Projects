    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "** Please note ** that the the purpose of generating a naive predictor is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look like.

    "**Naive bayes**\n",
    "\n",
    "The outlook is using naive bayes classifier to classify the email as either spam or not. The bayes classifier will be calculated the probability of a message being spam base on the contents. For example, if the content is included the word of ‘Money’, ‘Casino’ and ‘Free’, those words have high probability of containing spam message and the link with virus. The bayes is treated them easily and quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strength:\n",
    "- It has good performance for the small data set, and works well with very large numbers of features\n",
    "- It is suitable to deal with text data\n",
    "- It is simply, quick and effective\n",
    "- Easy to deal with multiple classify tasks. If the amount of dataset is over the memory,  then we can use batch way to train the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weakness:\n",
    "- It has bad performance for the large datasets.\n",
    "- It is very sensitive for the expression of input data.\n",
    "- The naive bayes probability is based on the independent features. However, the real life application is not always independent. if we have more relevant features in the dataset, the classifier will be performing not very well.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the Naive bayes is a classified algorithm that can be used for classified problem. I think the naive bayes will be doable in this project, because it is fast and simple algorithm that could be treated the dataset easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support vector machine**\n",
    "\n",
    "The support vector machine is usually used for face detection application. The SVC will be classified part of the image as a face and non-face by calculating all the pixels as feature. The dataset will be contained n x n pixels with a two class face(+1) and non-face (-1), and created the boundary around faces as representable pixel brightness within the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strength:\n",
    "- It is suitable for multiple features.\n",
    "- Suitable for small dataset because the computation is expensive.\n",
    "- It has the regularisation term in the algorithm, it potentially makes user think about avoiding the overfitting problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weakness:\n",
    "- The calculation is expensive when the dataset is large.\n",
    "- It is hard to deal with multi-class classification problem\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The support vector machine is also another suitable algorithm for this project. As we know, the svm is good at binary classification. Also, the dataset is small and easy to learn from multiple features. It will be having a good performance without much time spending.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision Tree**\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision tree can be used for predictions of healthcare management. Chang(2007) developed a decision tree model based on medical history of developmentally-delayed child. There are a few majority of illness that needs to identify, such as cognitive development, language development and motor development. And it gives high accuracy, which is 77.3%, 97.8% and 88.6%. So it helps healthcare professional to identity developmentally-delayed child in advance, then they can help them to development and growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strength:\n",
    "- Easy to build a model with small dataset\n",
    "- It is not sensitive with noisy and missing data\n",
    "- Can be used for regression and classification problem\n",
    "- It has a good performance with large dataset in the short period of time\n",
    "\n",
    "Weakness:\n",
    "- It is easy to overfitting\n",
    "- The DT is having the multiple comparison between values from features. It potential selects the noisy value from the dataset \n",
    "\n",
    "The decision tree is a quick way to perform a better result for classification problem. As they do not need to do many of data preprocessing and understand our dataset in the quickest way.\n"

However, the running time is using too much than the naive bayes and decision tree classifier. I think the suitability of algorithm will be decsion tree, even the support vector classifier with best performance. But the decision tree is having less running time and closing performance to SVC."

    "The decision tree is the decision model that uses the tree-like graph or model to predict and the algorithm will contain the conditions control statement. To the deeper the tree, there will be more complex decision rule to fit the model. It can handle regression and classification problem. For example, we need to predict the people who will donate or not based on their income in the CharityML. In this case, the income is the target variable that we needs to predict. We assume if the income is over 50k, then they will be interested to donate, otherwsie they will not.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, we need to predicct the target variable by training a model with features. We need to analyse the importance of features. For instance, the capital gain is the most of important features that if the person is increase income every year, then he/she is potential earn the income over 50K. So the parents tree will be started on capital gain, if the capital gain is yes, then it will move to the next feature with condition(Yes/No). Otherwise, the income will be less than 50k as default if it does not meet the capital gain condition. Finally, The tree will be iterated through all selected feature(known as leaf node) for predicted the target variable."

This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn.
